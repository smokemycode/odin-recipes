        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>I must warn you. This Seafood Lasagna is extremely rich! In taste and in 
            price. These ingredients aren’t cheap. But that’s what makes this dish a 
            special treat for special occasions. Trust me, it’s worth every dollar, 
            minute, and calorie!</p>
        <p>Spinach was added to cut the decadence a little. I am <strong>NOT</strong> a 
            fan of ricotta cheese! So I've created a cream cheese mixture to use in its 
            place. The lasagna was boiled al dente in water with a splash of liquid crab boil for 
            a kick of heat and flavor. For the seafood; shrimp, crawfish, and lump crab meat was used.
            And to top it all off, I finished it off with a blend of Mozzarella and Smoked Gouda cheeses.</p>
